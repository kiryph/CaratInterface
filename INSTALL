INSTALLATION

GAP is distributed together with a large number of packages, including
this one. Carat is located inside the subdirectory pkg/carat/ of your GAP
installation, and needs to be compiled. If you do not want to build all
packages with the script BuildPackages.sh from GAP, you can build Carat
alone by executing these commands inside the directory pkg/carat/:

    ./configure <path to GAP root>
    make

The configure script optionally takes the path to the root directory of 
your GAP installation as argument. The default ../.. should usually 
work, but if you have unpacked Carat to a location like ~/.gap/pkg/carat/, 
you need to explicitly give the path to the GAP root directory as argument.

As CARAT's catalog of Q-classes of unimodular groups is rather large,
it is unpacked by default only up to dimension 5. If you also want
to unpack the data for dimension 6, you can do this with the extra
command (again inside directory pkg/carat/)

    make qcat6

This adds another 150 Mb of data to the installation.
